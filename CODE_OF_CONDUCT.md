# Code of Conduct

## 🫱🏽‍🫲🏼 Our Commitment

We as members, contributors, and leaders commit to making participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We commit to acting and interacting in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## 🌟 Our Standards

✅ **Our community will:**

* Demonstrate respect toward each other
* Act in alignment with [Our Principles](./README.md/#🌏-our-principles)
* Foster an environment for innovation and learning
* Acknowledge that our differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences make our community better
* Be willing to accept and offer constructive feedback, guidance and mentorship
* Contribute in a manner that improves our community as a whole

❌ **Our community will not:**

* Tolerate attacking or exclusionary conduct towards any member
* Disclose private information of any member

## 🌎 Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## 👮🏽 Enforcement

We are building a community that empowers members to engage in open communication, 
conflict resolution, and collaboration. We encourage members to work collectively to 
address and solve disagreements. 

In the instance of severe violations or when leader mediation is required, please contact
one of the [community leaders](TEAM.md) directly.  

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly whilst respecting the privacy 
and security of the reporter. The outcome will only be communicated to the reporter and the accused. 

Community leaders are responsible for upholding our standards of
acceptable behavior. The community leaders will come to agreement 
on a response that is deemed appropriate and fair when enforcing our Code of Conduct.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.
